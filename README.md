Files related to building a model railroad helix.
This is a simple to use calculator to aid in building model railroad helixes. I personally built a dodecahedron (12 sided) helix.
My building technique involves inverted trapizoids that overlap. The layers are made into a two layer laminates.

Enter the number of sides you wish, and the midpoint radius of the external boarder and internal boarder. The spread sheet does the rest.
