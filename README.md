Files related to building a model railroad helix.
This is a simple to use calculator to aid in building model railroad helixes. I personally built a dodecahedron (12 sided) helix.
My building technique involves inverted trapizoids that overlap. The layers are made into a two layer laminates.

Enter the number of sides you wish, and the midpoint radius of the external boarder and internal boarder. The spread sheet does the rest.

The default values are for a docecahedron with an outside diameter of 38" and an inside diamemter of 30". Just change the three values on top for your desired dimentions.
